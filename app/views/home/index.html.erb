HOME PAGE VIEW - The main landing page template for our Rails 8 tutorial blog

RAILS CONCEPT: This is an ERB (Embedded Ruby) template that combines HTML with Ruby code.
ERB allows us to insert dynamic content into HTML using special tags:
- <% %> executes Ruby code but doesn't output anything
- <%= %> executes Ruby code AND outputs the result to the HTML
- <%# %> creates comments that won't appear in the final HTML

FILE NAMING CONVENTION: Rails automatically looks for this file when the 
HomeController's index action completes. The pattern is:
app/views/[controller_name]/[action_name].html.erb

LAYOUT INHERITANCE: This view will be inserted into the application layout
(app/views/layouts/application.html.erb) where the <%= yield %> tag appears.

STYLING NOTE: We're using basic CSS classes here. Rails includes minimal default
styling, but we'll enhance this with proper CSS in the application layout.

ACCESSIBILITY: Notice we use semantic HTML elements (section, h1-h3) and 
descriptive text for screen readers and SEO.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
1. Add dynamic content from the database (featured posts, recent activity)
2. Include user authentication status in the navigation
3. Add search functionality
4. Include testimonials or user feedback

RAILS CONVENTIONS DEMONSTRATED:
- ERB templating with explanatory comments
- Semantic HTML structure
- Placeholder content for future features
- External link handling with target="_blank"
