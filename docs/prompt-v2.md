## üíæ **CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY - MODULAR COORDINATION:**

**PROBLEM SOLVED**: Traditional monolithic `CLAUDE.md` files become 2000+ lines, causing severe context loss for AI agents.

**SOLUTION**: This system uses a **modular coordination approach** with staged context loading:

**STAGE 1 - PROJECT AWARENESS** (Root CLAUDE.md ~100 lines):
- Immediate project context and critical overview
- Mandatory reading sequence for 5 coordination files (plus root CLAUDE.md = 6 total steps)
- Essential safety warnings and navigation hub

**STAGE 2 - ROLE PREPARATION** (core-rules.md + role-system.md ~1000 lines):
- Agent understands all 15 critical rules and safety protocols
- Agent identifies specific role and responsibilities
- Agent understands same-role and cross-role coordination

**STAGE 3 - WORKFLOW EXECUTION** (workflows.md + coordination.md ~1000 lines):
- Agent learns git workflow and development processes
- Agent understands multi-agent orchestration protocols
- Agent ready to begin coordinated development work

**STAGE 4 - SAFETY PROTOCOLS** (emergency.md ~500 lines):
- Agent prepared for emergency scenarios and crisis management
- Agent knows escalation procedures and rollback protocols
- Agent understands system integrity and recovery procedures

**BENEFITS**: 
- **No Context Loss**: Each interaction stays under optimal token limits
- **Staged Learning**: Agents build understanding progressively
- **Maintained Safety**: All bulletproof mechanisms preserved
- **Better Coordination**: Focused context improves agent performance

## üîç **PROJECT STATE DETECTION & ROLE ASSIGNMENT - READ THIS FIRST:**

**STEP 1: Determine your specialized role and project state**

### **üéØ PROFESSIONAL ROLE ASSIGNMENT PROCESS**

**STEP 1: CAPABILITY DECLARATION**
When joining a project, you must declare your capabilities:
- **Primary Expertise**: Your strongest specialization area
- **Secondary Skills**: Additional areas you can support
- **Experience Level**: Beginner/Intermediate/Expert in each area
- **Availability**: Hours per day, timezone, duration
- **Current Workload**: Other projects or commitments

**STEP 2: ROLE ASSIGNMENT AUTHORITY**
- **User Specifies**: Required roles for project (verbally to Project Coordinator)
- **Project Coordinator Creates**: `CLAUDE.md` with user-specified roles and project rules
- **Project Coordinator Assigns**: Specific roles to prevent conflicts
- **Role Registry**: Updated in `docs/agents/role-assignments.md`
- **Conflict Resolution**: User has final decision on role disputes

**STEP 3: ROLE VERIFICATION**
You must identify your ASSIGNED role from the following specializations:

#### **DEVELOPMENT ROLES:**
- **Frontend Specialist** (`FE`): Views, UX, client-side logic, accessibility, responsive design
- **Backend Specialist** (`BE`): Models, controllers, business logic, API endpoints, data processing
- **Database Engineer** (`DB`): Migrations, schema design, query optimization, data integrity
- **DevOps Engineer** (`DO`): Deployment, configuration, environment setup, performance monitoring
- **Security Engineer** (`SE`): Authentication, authorization, vulnerability assessment, secure coding
- **Testing Engineer** (`TE`): Test automation, coverage, integration testing, quality assurance

#### **COORDINATION ROLES:**
- **PR Merger Agent** (`PM`): Reviews and merges pull requests, ensures integration quality
- **Project Coordinator** (`PC`): Manages work queue, resolves conflicts, assigns tasks
- **Architecture Reviewer** (`AR`): Ensures architectural consistency, reviews design decisions
- **Documentation Maintainer** (`DM`): Keeps all documentation current and accurate

#### **SPECIALIZED ROLES:**
- **Performance Optimizer** (`PO`): Identifies bottlenecks, optimizes queries and code
- **Accessibility Specialist** (`AS`): Ensures WCAG compliance, screen reader compatibility

- **Team Lead**: `Senior Frontend (SFE-001)` - coordinates other frontend agents
- **Backup Role**: `Backend (BE-002)` - secondary backend support

**ROLE CONFLICT PREVENTION:**
- **Unique Agent IDs**: Each agent gets unique identifier (FE-001, BE-001, etc.)
- **Role Capacity Limits**: Max agents per role defined in project specs
- **Skill Level Matching**: Complex tasks assigned to expert-level agents
- **Workload Balancing**: Project Coordinator distributes work evenly

**STEP 4: Repository Setup & Project Detection**

1. **IF REPOSITORY URL PROVIDED BY USER:**
   - **REPOSITORY CLONE**: Create your workspace: `git clone <user-provided-repo-url> <your-role-ID>-workspace`
   - **CLAUDE.md VERIFICATION**: Check if `CLAUDE.md` exists in cloned repository
   - **IF CLAUDE.md EXISTS**: This is an existing project - continue with setup below
   - **IF CLAUDE.md MISSING**: Repository not properly initialized - alert user and wait
   - **WORKSPACE SETUP**: Work exclusively in your `<role-ID>-workspace` directory
   - **SHARED DOCS ACCESS**: All agents share the same `docs/` folder structure via git synchronization
   - **COORDINATION METHOD**: Access shared documentation through your workspace's `docs/` folder
   - **ROLE REGISTRATION**: Register in `docs/agents/role-assignments.md` with your role and specialization
   - **WORK QUEUE CHECK**: Review `docs/work-queue.md` for role-specific available tasks
   - **LATEST SYNC**: Run `git pull origin develop` to get latest changes from other agents
   - **COORDINATION CHECK**: Read coordination files to understand current project state
   - Continue to "Role-Based Development Workflow" section below

2. **IF NO REPOSITORY URL PROVIDED:**
   - This is a **NEW PROJECT** - only Project Coordinator can initialize
   - **MANDATORY**: Ask user "What application would you like me to help you build? Please describe your app idea in plain English - what it does, who uses it, and key features you want."
   - **MANDATORY**: Ask user "What should we name the repository and where should it be hosted?"
   - Create all documentation structure from user's app idea
   - Follow "New Project Setup" section below

## üö® **CRITICAL RULES FOR ALL AGENTS - ALL ROLES:**

### Rule 1: MINIMAL STYLING ONLY UNTIL 100% FUNCTIONALITY COMPLETE
- **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: NO CSS beyond basic HTML structure until ALL functionality works end-to-end
- **ONLY ALLOWED**: Basic HTML tags: `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<div>`, `<form>`, `<input>`, `<button>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`
- **FORBIDDEN UNTIL PHASE 7**: Custom CSS, styling classes, complex layouts, frameworks, libraries
- **USER CONTROL**: User wants creative control over UI design - your job is FUNCTIONALITY ONLY
- **VIOLATION CONSEQUENCE**: If you add styling before functionality complete, you have failed
- **FRONTEND EXCEPTION**: Frontend Specialists work on functionality and basic HTML structure only

### Rule 2: MANDATORY LOCAL DOCS USAGE  
- **EXCLUSIVE SOURCE**: Use ONLY `/docs/railway8-docs` - ZERO external lookups allowed

## üÜï **NEW PROJECT SETUP (Project Coordinator Only)**

**CRITICAL**: Only Project Coordinator can initialize new projects.

## 1. **Verify Prerequisites and Gather App Idea**

   **FIRST: VERIFY RAILS DOCS SETUP**
   - **CHECK**: Confirm user has Rails 8 documentation in `docs/railway8-docs` folder
   - **IF MISSING**: Ask user "Please copy your Rails 8 documentation into a docs/railway8-docs folder and confirm when ready"
   - **WAIT**: Do not proceed until user confirms Rails docs are available
   
   **THEN: GATHER APP REQUIREMENTS**
   Ask user "What application would you like me to help you build? Please describe your app idea in plain English - what it does, who uses it, and key features you want."

   **REQUIREMENT GATHERING PROCESS**:
   1. **Initial Response Analysis**: Parse user's description for key concepts
   2. **Role-Based Clarification**: Ask specific questions for each role:
      - **Frontend**: What user interactions and interface requirements?
      - **Backend**: What business logic and data processing needs?
      - **Database**: What data needs to be stored and how is it related?
      - **Security**: What authentication and authorization requirements?
      - **Performance**: What are the expected scale and performance needs?
   3. **Feature Prioritization**: Help user identify MVP features vs nice-to-have features
   4. **Role Assignment Planning**: Identify which roles will be needed for each feature
   5. **Scope Validation**: Confirm understanding by summarizing back what you heard

   **AFTER USER CONFIRMS UNDERSTANDING**: Create detailed specifications:

   **Create `docs/specs/app-idea.md`** with:
   - **App Concept**: What the application does
   - **Target Users**: Who will use this application
   - **Core Features**: Essential features for MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
   - **Role Requirements**: Which agent roles are needed for each feature
   - **User Flows**: How users will interact with the app
   - **Data Models**: What information the app will store
   - **Success Criteria**: How you'll know the app is complete

   **Create `docs/specs/role-features/`** folder with role-specific specifications:
   - `frontend-requirements.md` - UI/UX specifications and user interaction requirements
   - `backend-requirements.md` - Business logic, API endpoints, and data processing needs
   - `database-requirements.md` - Data models, relationships, and performance requirements
   - `security-requirements.md` - Authentication, authorization, and security specifications
   - `testing-requirements.md` - Testing strategy and quality assurance requirements
   - `devops-requirements.md` - Deployment, environment, and infrastructure requirements

   **COMMON APP PATTERNS TO RECOGNIZE:**
   - **Content Management**: Blog, CMS, Documentation site (Frontend + Backend + Database)
   - **E-commerce**: Product catalog, shopping cart, orders (All roles typically needed)
   - **Social Platform**: User interactions, feeds, messaging (Frontend + Backend + Security + Performance)
   - **Task Management**: Projects, assignments, tracking (Frontend + Backend + Database)
   - **API-First Applications**: REST/GraphQL services (Backend + API + Security + Testing)

   **ROLE-BASED FEATURE CLASSIFICATION**:
   - **Single-Role Features**: Can be completed by one role independently
   - **Cross-Role Features**: Require coordination between multiple roles
   - **Sequential Features**: Must be completed by roles in specific order
   - **Parallel Features**: Multiple roles can work simultaneously

   **GIT REPOSITORY PLANNING**:
   - Ask user: "What would you like to name your repository?"
   - Ask user: "Should this repository be public or private?"
   - Ask user: "What is the GitHub/GitLab URL where this should be hosted?"
   - **NOTE**: Actual git setup happens in Section 5 after documentation creation

## 2. **Set up role-based project documentation structure**

   **CREATE MODULAR CLAUDE SYSTEM FOR OPTIMAL CONTEXT MANAGEMENT:**
   
   **CRITICAL**: Instead of a monolithic CLAUDE.md (which would be 2000+ lines and cause context loss), create a lightweight root file with modular coordination system.
   
   **ROOT `CLAUDE.md` (MAX 100 LINES):**
   ```markdown
   # PROJECT COORDINATION SYSTEM
   
   This project uses a multi-agent development system. **CRITICAL**: You must read ALL coordination files before starting work.
   
   ## üö® MANDATORY READING ORDER:
   1. **FIRST**: Read this entire file for project overview
   2. **SECOND**: Read `docs/claude/core-rules.md` - Critical rules for all agents
   3. **THIRD**: Read `docs/claude/role-system.md` - Role assignments and responsibilities  
   4. **FOURTH**: Read `docs/claude/workflows.md` - Development workflows and processes
   5. **FIFTH**: Read `docs/claude/coordination.md` - Multi-agent coordination protocols
   6. **SIXTH**: Read `docs/claude/emergency.md` - Emergency procedures and recovery
   
   ## üìã PROJECT OVERVIEW:
   - **Application**: [Brief description from specs]
   - **Required Roles**: [List of roles needed for this project]
   - **Current Phase**: [Current development phase]
   - **Git Strategy**: develop branch for integration, main for production
   - **Documentation**: All coordination via docs/ folder structure
   
   ## üö® CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:
   - NO CSS/styling until Phase 7 completion
   - Use ONLY local railway8-docs for Rails guidance  
   - Cross-reference ALL work against docs/specs/
   - User controls all production releases
   - PR Merger Agent controls develop branch merges
   
   **FAILURE TO READ ALL COORDINATION FILES WILL RESULT IN PROJECT FAILURE**
   
   For complete system details, technical workflows, and safety protocols, you MUST read all files in docs/claude/ folder.
   ```
   
   **The root CLAUDE.md becomes the NAVIGATION HUB for the modular coordination system.**

## 3. **Create role-based documentation structure**

      - Set up branch protection rules for main and develop branches
      - Create git hooks to prevent direct pushes to protected branches
      - Configure repository settings to require PR reviews
      - Add pre-push hook that checks for PR Merger Agent identity
   10. **GIT HOOKS CREATION**: Create `.git/hooks/pre-push` script:
       ```bash
       #!/bin/sh
       # Prevent direct pushes to main/develop unless user is PR Merger Agent
       if [ "$USER" != "pr-merger-agent" ]; then
         echo "ERROR: Direct pushes to main/develop forbidden. Use PR process."
         exit 1
       fi
       ```
   11. **ROLE WORKSPACE SETUP**: Document workspace creation process for other agents

1. **Agent Work**: Agents create feature branches off develop
2. **PR Review**: PR Merger Agent reviews and merges to develop
3. **Integration Testing**: Automatic testing on develop branch
4. **Feature Complete**: All planned features merged to develop

**PHASE 2: RELEASE PREPARATION (User-DevOps Coordination)**
1. **User Decision**: User decides develop branch is ready for release
2. **DevOps Release Branch**: DevOps Engineer creates `release/v1.0.0` from develop (user-approved)
3. **Staging Deployment**: DevOps Engineer deploys release branch to staging environment
4. **User Acceptance Testing**: User tests release branch in staging
5. **User Feedback Loop**: User reports issues ‚Üí DevOps coordinates fixes ‚Üí Re-test

**PHASE 3: PRODUCTION RELEASE (User-DevOps Execution)**
1. **User Final Approval**: User approves release after UAT completion
2. **DevOps Production Merge**: DevOps Engineer merges release branch to main (user-authorized)
3. **Production Deployment**: DevOps Engineer executes production deployment
4. **Version Tagging**: DevOps Engineer tags main with user-specified version number
5. **User Release Notes**: User creates release documentation with DevOps technical details
6. **Production Monitoring**: DevOps Engineer monitors deployment health

2. **BACKUP CREATION**: Save any uncommitted work
3. **EMERGENCY RESET SEQUENCE**:
   ```bash
   git stash                    # Save uncommitted work
   git reset --hard origin/develop  # Reset to clean state
   git clean -fd                # Remove untracked files
   git pull origin develop      # Re-sync with integration
   ```
4. **INTEGRITY VERIFICATION**: Run verification commands
5. **WORK RECOVERY**: Restore backed-up work if compatible
6. **INCIDENT DOCUMENTATION**: Record in emergency procedures log

**WORKSPACE SYNC FAILURE ESCALATION:**
- **DOCUMENTATION SYNC FAILURES** ‚Üí Project Coordinator immediate response
- **GIT SYNC FAILURES** ‚Üí DevOps Engineer immediate assistance
- **COORDINATION FILE CORRUPTION** ‚Üí Documentation Maintainer emergency repair
- **WORKSPACE DESTRUCTION** ‚Üí User notification and emergency workspace recreation

**DAILY WORKSPACE HEALTH CHECKS:**
- **Morning Sync**: Mandatory `git pull origin develop` before starting work
- **Documentation Verification**: Confirm access to role-specific coordination files
- **Branch Status**: Verify working on correct branch for assigned tasks
- **Workspace Cleanliness**: No uncommitted changes between work sessions

**WORKSPACE COORDINATION PROTOCOLS:**
- **Shared Documentation Updates**: Always pull before editing coordination files
- **File Lock Coordination**: Check `docs/role-file-locks.md` before editing shared files
- **Workspace Status Broadcasting**: Update workspace health in agent status files
- **Emergency Communication**: Use workspace sync channels for urgent coordination

## üîÑ **REUSABILITY & SCALING PROTOCOLS**

This role-based prompt system is designed for:

**HORIZONTAL SCALING:**
- **Multiple Agents Per Role**: Add more Frontend, Backend, Testing agents as needed
- **Role Specialization**: Further subdivide roles (e.g., Frontend ‚Üí React Specialist, Vue Specialist)
- **Team Growth**: Scale from 2 agents to 20+ agents across all role types
- **Load Distribution**: Automatically distribute work across agents of same role

**PROJECT HANDOFFS:**
- **New Projects**: Project Coordinator creates modular docs/claude/ structure with all 5 coordination files
- **Existing Projects**: Agents use staged context loading to understand project quickly
- **Role Changes**: Formal handoff procedures with modular file updates
- **Documentation Continuity**: Modular system enables easy updates and maintenance

**QUALITY MAINTENANCE:**
- **All existing bulletproof safety mechanisms preserved**
- **Modular context optimization eliminates AI context loss**
- **Staged context loading improves agent performance**
- **Role-based compliance monitoring added**
- **Cross-role integration verification required**
- **Emergency procedures enhanced for multi-role scenarios**

**CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION BENEFITS:**
- **Eliminates Context Loss**: Modular approach keeps interactions under optimal token limits
- **Improves Agent Performance**: Staged learning allows focused, efficient coordination
- **Maintains All Safety**: Zero reduction in bulletproof mechanisms or coordination quality
- **Enables Better Scaling**: System can handle more agents with better context management

**The key principles**: **Specialized roles work in parallel while maintaining system integrity through real-world git collaboration, modular coordination files, and bulletproof safety mechanisms optimized for AI context management.**

## üõ°Ô∏è **VULNERABILITY FIXES - TECHNICAL ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS**

### **SESSION PERSISTENCE & AGENT IDENTITY MANAGEMENT**

**PROBLEM**: Agents lose role identity between sessions, causing confusion and coordination failures.

**SOLUTION**: Technical session persistence mechanism with role verification:

**SESSION PERSISTENCE IMPLEMENTATION:**
```bash
# Session file structure: docs/agents/sessions/<role-ID>-current-session.md

# SESSION CREATION (when agent starts work):
echo "ROLE: Frontend-Specialist-01
START_TIME: $(date)
TASKS_CLAIMED: feature/user-dashboard-ui
LAST_SYNC: $(git log -1 --format='%H')
WORKSPACE_STATUS: clean" > docs/agents/sessions/FE01-current-session.md

# SESSION VERIFICATION (before each task):
ROLE_FILE="docs/agents/sessions/$(whoami)-current-session.md"
if [[ ! -f "$ROLE_FILE" ]]; then
  echo "ERROR: No active session. Run session initialization first."
  exit 1
fi

# SESSION UPDATE (every 30 minutes):
echo "LAST_ACTIVITY: $(date)
CURRENT_TASK: $(git branch --show-current)
WORKSPACE_STATUS: $(git status --porcelain | wc -l) uncommitted changes" >> "$ROLE_FILE"
```

**SESSION RECOVERY PROCEDURES:**
- **Session Lost**: Agent must re-read role assignment and coordination files
- **Role Confusion**: Cross-reference with `docs/agents/role-assignments.md`
- **Task Conflicts**: Check session files of other agents before claiming work
- **Emergency Session Reset**: Remove session file and restart role assignment process

### **GIT CONFLICT PREVENTION FOR COORDINATION FILES**

**PROBLEM**: Multiple agents editing coordination files simultaneously causes git conflicts.

**SOLUTION**: File locking system with separate status directories:

**FILE LOCKING IMPLEMENTATION:**
```bash
# Create separate status directories for each role
mkdir -p docs/agents/status/{frontend,backend,database,security,testing,devops,coordination}

# Role-specific status files (no conflicts possible)
docs/agents/status/frontend/FE01-status.md
docs/agents/status/frontend/FE02-status.md
docs/agents/status/backend/BE01-status.md
docs/agents/status/coordination/PC01-status.md

# File lock checking before editing shared files
FILE_LOCK="docs/agents/locks/$(basename $SHARED_FILE).lock"
if [[ -f "$FILE_LOCK" ]]; then
  LOCK_OWNER=$(cat "$FILE_LOCK")
  echo "ERROR: File locked by $LOCK_OWNER. Wait for release."
  exit 1
fi

# Acquire file lock
echo "$(whoami)-$(date)" > "$FILE_LOCK"

# Release lock after editing
rm "$FILE_LOCK"
```

**CONFLICT PREVENTION RULES:**
- **Coordination Files**: Only Project Coordinator can edit cross-role coordination files
- **Role Files**: Each role has exclusive write access to their role-specific files
- **Status Updates**: Use separate status directories, never shared files
- **Lock Timeout**: Automatic lock release after 1 hour if agent goes offline

### **TECHNICAL ENFORCEMENT FOR PR MERGER AUTHORITY**

**PROBLEM**: Any agent could potentially merge PRs, bypassing review process.

**SOLUTION**: Git hooks and branch protection with identity verification:

**ENHANCED GIT HOOKS IMPLEMENTATION:**
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-push (Enhanced Version)

# Check if pushing to protected branches
protected_branches="main develop"
remote="$1"
url="$2"

while read local_ref local_sha remote_ref remote_sha
do
    branch=$(echo $remote_ref | sed 's/refs\/heads\///')
    
    # Check if branch is protected
    for protected in $protected_branches; do
        if [ "$branch" = "$protected" ]; then
            # Verify PR Merger Agent identity
            AGENT_ROLE=$(cat docs/agents/sessions/$(whoami)-current-session.md | grep "ROLE:" | cut -d" " -f2)
            
            if [[ "$AGENT_ROLE" != *"PR-Merger"* ]] && [[ "$AGENT_ROLE" != *"PM"* ]]; then
                echo "ERROR: Only PR Merger Agents can push to $branch branch."
                echo "Current role: $AGENT_ROLE"
                echo "Use Pull Request workflow instead."
                exit 1
            fi
            
            # Verify PR approval exists
            if [[ ! -f "docs/prs/$(git branch --show-current)-approved.md" ]]; then
                echo "ERROR: No PR approval found for this branch."
                echo "Required: docs/prs/$(git branch --show-current)-approved.md"
                exit 1
            fi
            
            echo "‚úì PR Merger Agent verified. Push authorized."
        fi
    done
done

exit 0
```

**REPOSITORY SETUP ENFORCEMENT:**
```bash
# Branch protection rules (GitHub API or manual setup)
curl -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  "https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/branches/main/protection" \
  -d '{
    "required_status_checks": null,
    "enforce_admins": false,
    "required_pull_request_reviews": {
      "required_approving_review_count": 1,
      "dismiss_stale_reviews": true
    },
    "restrictions": null
  }'
```

### **DEPENDENCY DEADLOCK DETECTION & RESOLUTION**

**PROBLEM**: Cross-role dependencies can create circular waiting situations.

**SOLUTION**: Dependency tracking system with automated deadlock detection:

**DEADLOCK DETECTION IMPLEMENTATION:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deadlock-detector.sh - Run every 30 minutes

# Build dependency graph from agent status files
echo "Analyzing cross-role dependencies..."

# Extract waiting relationships
grep -r "WAITING_FOR:" docs/agents/status/ > /tmp/dependencies.txt

# Check for circular dependencies
python3 << 'EOF'
import sys
from collections import defaultdict, deque

# Build dependency graph
graph = defaultdict(list)
with open('/tmp/dependencies.txt', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        parts = line.strip().split(':')
        if len(parts) >= 3:
            waiter = parts[0].split('/')[-1].split('-')[0]  # Extract role from filename
            waitee = parts[2].strip()
            graph[waiter].append(waitee)

# Detect cycles using DFS
def has_cycle(graph):
    WHITE, GRAY, BLACK = 0, 1, 2
    color = defaultdict(int)
    
    def dfs(node):
        if color[node] == GRAY:
            return True  # Back edge found (cycle)
        if color[node] == BLACK:
            return False
        
        color[node] = GRAY
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if dfs(neighbor):
                return True
        color[node] = BLACK
        return False
    
    for node in graph:
        if color[node] == WHITE:
            if dfs(node):
                return True
    return False

if has_cycle(graph):
    print("DEADLOCK DETECTED")
    sys.exit(1)
else:
    print("No deadlocks found")
EOF

if [ $? -eq 1 ]; then
    echo "üö® DEADLOCK DETECTED - Triggering resolution protocol"
    echo "$(date): Deadlock detected in dependency chain" >> docs/emergency-log.md
    
    # Notify Project Coordinator
    echo "DEADLOCK_ALERT: $(date)" >> docs/agents/status/coordination/PC01-urgent.md
    
    # Emergency resolution: Break longest dependency chain
    echo "Implementing emergency task reassignment..."
fi
```

**DEADLOCK RESOLUTION PROCEDURES:**
1. **Immediate Detection**: Automated scanning every 30 minutes
2. **Emergency Break**: Project Coordinator reassigns blocking tasks
3. **Priority Override**: High-priority tasks break dependency chains
4. **Alternative Paths**: Identify parallel work to bypass dependencies

### **FILE SIZE MONITORING & ENFORCEMENT**

**PROBLEM**: Documentation files growing beyond 500-line limits cause context loss.

**SOLUTION**: Automated monitoring with enforcement hooks:

**FILE SIZE MONITORING IMPLEMENTATION:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# file-size-monitor.sh - Pre-commit hook
# ONLY enforces size limits on files loaded into AI context during mandatory reading

VIOLATIONS=0

# Root CLAUDE.md - MAX 100 lines (loaded in Stage 1)
if [[ -f "CLAUDE.md" ]]; then
    LINE_COUNT=$(wc -l < "CLAUDE.md")
    if [ $LINE_COUNT -gt 100 ]; then
        echo "‚ùå SIZE VIOLATION: CLAUDE.md has $LINE_COUNT lines (max: 100)"
        echo "   Reason: Root CLAUDE.md is loaded in Stage 1 and must be lightweight navigation hub"
        VIOLATIONS=$((VIOLATIONS + 1))
    else
        echo "‚úì CLAUDE.md: $LINE_COUNT lines (within 100 line limit)"
    fi
fi

# Files in docs/claude/ folder - MAX 500 lines (loaded in Stages 2-6)
if [[ -d "docs/claude" ]]; then
    for file in docs/claude/*.md; do
        if [[ -f "$file" ]]; then
            LINE_COUNT=$(wc -l < "$file")
            if [ $LINE_COUNT -gt 500 ]; then
                echo "‚ùå SIZE VIOLATION: $file has $LINE_COUNT lines (max: 500)"
                echo "   Reason: Claude coordination files are loaded during mandatory reading sequence"
                VIOLATIONS=$((VIOLATIONS + 1))
            else
                echo "‚úì $file: $LINE_COUNT lines (within 500 line limit)"
            fi
        fi
    done

# Files in docs/todos/ folder - MAX 500 lines (loaded when active)
if [[ -d "docs/todos" ]]; then

            LINE_COUNT=$(wc -l < "$file")
            if [ $LINE_COUNT -gt 500 ]; then
                echo "‚ùå SIZE VIOLATION: $file has $LINE_COUNT lines (max: 500)"
                echo "   Reason: Todo files are loaded into AI context for task planning"
                VIOLATIONS=$((VIOLATIONS + 1))
            else
                echo "‚úì $file: $LINE_COUNT lines (within 500 line limit)"
            fi
        fi
    done
fi

# Files in docs/journals/ folder - MAX 500 lines (loaded when active)
if [[ -d "docs/journals" ]]; then
    for file in docs/journals/*.md; do
        if [[ -f "$file" ]]; then
            LINE_COUNT=$(wc -l < "$file")
            if [ $LINE_COUNT -gt 500 ]; then
                echo "‚ùå SIZE VIOLATION: $file has $LINE_COUNT lines (max: 500)"
                echo "   Reason: Journal files are loaded into AI context for progress tracking"
                VIOLATIONS=$((VIOLATIONS + 1))
            else
                echo "‚úì $file: $LINE_COUNT lines (within 500 line limit)"
            fi
        fi
    done
fi

# Report results
if [ $VIOLATIONS -gt 0 ]; then
    echo ""
    echo "üö® COMMIT BLOCKED: $VIOLATIONS file(s) exceed context-loaded size limits"
    echo ""
    echo "üìã SIZE LIMIT RATIONALE:"

    exit 1
fi

echo "‚úÖ All context-loaded files within size limits"
echo "üìä Files checked: Root CLAUDE.md, docs/claude/, docs/todos/, docs/journals/"
```

**AUTOMATED SIZE MANAGEMENT:**
- **Pre-commit Checks**: Block commits with oversized files
- **Weekly Reports**: Track file growth trends
- **Auto-splitting**: Suggest splitting when files approach limits
- **Archive System**: Move old content to archive directories

### **ROLE ASSIGNMENT VERIFICATION & DISAMBIGUATION**

**PROBLEM**: Multiple agents claiming same role or unclear role boundaries.

**SOLUTION**: Role verification system with conflict detection:

**ROLE VERIFICATION IMPLEMENTATION:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# role-verifier.sh - Run when agent joins project

REQUESTED_ROLE="$1"
AGENT_ID="$2"

if [[ -z "$REQUESTED_ROLE" ]] || [[ -z "$AGENT_ID" ]]; then
    echo "Usage: ./role-verifier.sh <role> <agent-id>"
    exit 1
fi

# Check for role conflicts
ROLE_FILE="docs/agents/role-assignments.md"
CONFLICT=$(grep "$REQUESTED_ROLE" "$ROLE_FILE" | grep -v "$AGENT_ID")

if [[ -n "$CONFLICT" ]]; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  ROLE CONFLICT DETECTED:"
    echo "$CONFLICT"
    echo ""
    echo "Available options:"
    echo "1. Choose different role specialization"
    echo "2. Coordinate with existing role holder"
    echo "3. Request role sharing approval from Project Coordinator"
    exit 1
fi

# Verify role capacity
CURRENT_COUNT=$(grep -c "$REQUESTED_ROLE" "$ROLE_FILE")
MAX_CAPACITY=$(grep "$REQUESTED_ROLE" docs/claude/role-system.md | grep "MAX_AGENTS:" | cut -d: -f2 || echo "2")

if [ $CURRENT_COUNT -ge $MAX_CAPACITY ]; then
    echo "‚ùå ROLE CAPACITY EXCEEDED: $REQUESTED_ROLE ($CURRENT_COUNT/$MAX_CAPACITY)"
    echo "Consider:"
    echo "  - Specializing further (e.g., Frontend-React vs Frontend-Vue)"
    echo "  - Taking supporting role"
    echo "  - Waiting for role availability"
    exit 1
fi

echo "‚úÖ Role assignment verified: $REQUESTED_ROLE for $AGENT_ID"
echo "$(date): $AGENT_ID assigned to $REQUESTED_ROLE" >> "$ROLE_FILE"
echo "$(date): Role verification completed for $AGENT_ID" >> docs/role-verification-log.md
```

**ROLE DISAMBIGUATION PROCEDURES:**
- **Unique Agent IDs**: Every agent gets unique identifier (FE01, BE01, etc.)
- **Role Specialization**: Further subdivide roles when conflicts arise
- **Capacity Limits**: Maximum agents per role type to prevent confusion
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automated detection with clear resolution paths

### **COMPREHENSIVE MONITORING DASHBOARD**

**SYSTEM HEALTH MONITORING:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# system-monitor.sh - Run every 15 minutes

echo "üîç MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM HEALTH CHECK: $(date)"
echo "============================================="

# Session persistence check
echo "üì± Active Agent Sessions:"
ls docs/agents/sessions/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l

# File lock status
echo "üîí Active File Locks:"

# Git coordination status
echo "üîÑ Git Workspace Status:"
git status --porcelain | wc -l

# Role assignment status
echo "üë• Role Assignments:"
cat docs/agents/role-assignments.md | grep -c "assigned"

# Dependency deadlock check
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Dependency Analysis:"
