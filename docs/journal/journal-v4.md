8. 🚧 Root README update → **PENDING**
9. 🚧 Deployment instructions → **PENDING**

## What's Left According to Original Prompt

According to `docs/prompt.md`, we need to complete:

### 📚 **Tutorial Documentation Structure**:
```
docs/tutorial-blog/
├── README.md (overview & how to follow steps)
├── 01-setup.md
├── 02-public-interface.md
├── 03-admin-auth.md  
├── 04-admin-crud.md
└── 05-deployment.md (Kamal + Railway instructions)
```

### 📝 **Root README Update**:
- Describe the tutorial app
- Link to `docs/README.md`
- Explain how to use the tutorial

### 🚀 **Deployment Documentation**:
- Kamal deployment instructions
- Railway deployment instructions  
- Reference `/docs/railway8-docs`

## Deviations from Original Plan

### ✅ **Positive Deviations** (Enhanced the tutorial):
1. **Extensive Code Commenting**: Added detailed comments for Rails beginners
2. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Fixed authentication and routing issues
3. **Professional UI**: Added styling for better user experience
4. **Security Best Practices**: Implemented proper authentication and authorization
5. **Database Optimization**: Added proper indexing and N+1 query prevention

### 📋 **Areas That Followed Plan Exactly**:
1. **Documentation Structure**: Followed versioned journal system (500-line limit)
2. **Task Management**: Used `docs/todo.md` throughout development
3. **Phase Structure**: Completed phases 1-5 as outlined
4. **Rails 8 Focus**: Used only local documentation in `/docs/railway8-docs`
5. **Testing Strategy**: Tested each feature end-to-end before proceeding

### 🎯 **No Negative Deviations**: 
All core requirements met, with enhancements that improve the tutorial value.

## Phase 6 Implementation Plan

### Task 1: Root README Update
