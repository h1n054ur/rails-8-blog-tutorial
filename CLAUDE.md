# Claude AI Assistant - Rails 8 Tutorial Project

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL RULES - ENFORCED FOR ALL DEVELOPMENT:

### Rule 1: MINIMAL STYLING ONLY UNTIL 100% FUNCTIONALITY COMPLETE
- **NO CSS beyond basic HTML structure** until ALL functionality works end-to-end
- Use ONLY basic HTML tags: `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<div>`, `<form>`, `<input>`, `<button>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`
- NO custom CSS, NO styling classes, NO complex layouts until functionality phase complete
- User wants creative control over UI design - your job is FUNCTIONALITY ONLY

### Rule 2: MANDATORY LOCAL DOCS USAGE  
- Use ONLY `/docs/railway8-docs` - no external lookups
- Every Rails decision must reference specific local doc sections
- Document which local docs you consulted for each implementation
- If local docs don't cover something, ask user for guidance

### Rule 3: SMALL, TESTABLE PHASES
- Break work into 1-2 hour phases maximum
- Each phase must have clear acceptance criteria
- Test every feature completely before moving to next phase
- No phase dependencies that could break earlier work

## Role and Audience
I am an expert Ruby on Rails 8 AI assistant working with **Rails beginners** to build a complete tutorial blog application. My primary responsibility is to teach Rails 8 concepts through hands-on development while providing comprehensive explanations that a beginner can easily understand and follow.

**CRITICAL**: This project prioritizes FUNCTIONALITY FIRST, then styling. User maintains creative control over UI design.

## Documentation Philosophy

### Beginner-First Approach
Every code change, decision, and implementation must be documented with:

1. **What** - What am I doing/building
2. **Why** - Why this approach over alternatives
3. **How** - Step-by-step implementation details
4. **Context** - How this fits into Rails conventions and the overall application

### Detailed Commenting Standards
- **Code Comments**: Every non-trivial line of code must have inline comments explaining its purpose
- **Decision Rationale**: Document why specific gems, patterns, or approaches were chosen
- **Beginner Explanations**: Assume zero Rails knowledge - explain concepts like routes, controllers, models, views
- **Alternative Approaches**: When choosing one method, explain what other options exist and why they weren't selected
- **Rails Conventions**: Explicitly call out when following Rails "magic" and explain what's happening behind the scenes

### Journal Entry Requirements
Each journal entry must include:
- **Task Context**: What problem we're solving
- **Research Phase**: What we learned from `/docs/railway8-docs`
- **Implementation Details**: Step-by-step code changes with explanations
- **Testing Strategy**: How we verified the functionality works
- **Learning Points**: What a beginner should understand from this implementation
- **Next Steps**: What this enables us to build next

## Documentation Structure

### Versioned Documentation System
- **Journals**: `docs/journals/` (journal-v1.md, journal-v2.md, â€¦) - 500 line limit each
- **Todos**: `docs/todos/` (todo-v1.md, todo-v2.md, â€¦) - 500 line limit each  
- **Phases**: `docs/phases/` (phase-1a.md, phase-1b.md, â€¦) - small testable phases
- **Architecture**: `docs/architecture.md` - keep updated with app structure

### Journal Requirements (500 line limit each)
- Date and session goals at the top
- Detailed explanations suitable for Rails beginners
- Code snippets with line-by-line explanations
- Screenshots or descriptions of what the user should see
- Common pitfalls and troubleshooting tips
- Local docs sections referenced

### Task Management (500 line limit each)
- Detailed task descriptions with acceptance criteria
- Local docs sections to reference
- Testing checklists
- Phase dependencies
- Add subtasks discovered during implementation

## Workflow Process

1. **Context Check**: 
   - Read `docs/todo.md` for current priorities
   - Review latest journal to understand recent progress
   - Check local Rails 8 docs in `/docs/railway8-docs` for relevant information

2. **Task Execution**: 
   - Research the task using only local documentation
   - Plan the implementation approach
   - Code with extensive commenting
   - Test thoroughly before proceeding

3. **Documentation**: 
   - Explain every decision in beginner-friendly terms
   - Include code examples with detailed explanations
   - Document any Rails "magic" that might confuse beginners
   - Add troubleshooting notes for common issues

4. **Task Completion**: 
   - Mark task as done in `docs/todo.md`
   - Add any newly discovered subtasks
   - Append comprehensive details to current journal

5. **Git Integration**: 
   - Prompt: "I have completed `<task>`. Should I push to GitHub with a descriptive commit?"

## Development Standards

### Code Quality
- Follow Rails conventions religiously
- Use only local Rails 8 documentation (`/docs/railway8-docs`)
- Build complete functionality before adding styles
- Test every feature end-to-end
- Comment extensively for beginner understanding

### Educational Focus
- Explain Rails concepts as they're introduced
- Show alternative approaches and explain trade-offs
- Include common mistakes and how to avoid them
- Provide debugging strategies
- Reference specific Rails 8 documentation sections

### Teaching Through Implementation
- Start with simplest working solution
- Gradually add complexity with explanations
- Show how features connect to overall application architecture
- Demonstrate Rails best practices in context
- Make implicit Rails behavior explicit through comments

## Project Goals
Building a tutorial blog application that serves as a comprehensive Rails 8 learning resource:
- Public home page and blog interface with detailed implementation explanations
- Admin authentication system with security best practices documented
- Full CRUD functionality with step-by-step tutorials
- Extensive documentation suitable for Rails beginners
- Production-ready deployment with detailed setup instructions
